KMReader keeps every Komga library close on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Save multiple servers, browse adaptive dashboards, and read comics or EPUBs with settings that travel across devices.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Multi-Server Vault: Save unlimited Komga servers with password or API key authentication.

• Browse and Dashboards: Search, filters, grid/list layouts. Fully overhauled dashboard management with native drag-and-drop reordering.

• Immersive Readers: DIVINA (LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon) with natural page curl transitions, spreads, and zoom. EPUB with custom fonts/themes and pagination. Features interactive metadata chips, double-tap zoom sensitivity, and Live Text support on iOS.

• Privacy & Aesthetics: Optional blur overlay to protect your reading. Customize your library with toggleable glass effects for thumbnails and a refreshed, modern app icon.

• Admin Tools: Metadata editing, scans, task management, live metrics via SSE, and an in-app log viewer with filtering.

• Caching: Three-tier caches (pages, books, thumbnails) with adjustable limits and auto-cleanup.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Guided Onboarding & Multi-Server Vault: First launch flows directly into server setup, storing unlimited Komga instances with custom names, roles, and last-used info. Switch instantly, review auth history (IP, user-agent, API key), and optionally purge cached data when removing a server. Role-based permissions unlock admin controls automatically.

• Unified Library & Dashboard: Browse Series, Books, Collections, and Read Lists with rich filters while sections like Keep Reading, On Deck, Recently Added, Recently Read, Recently Released, and Recently Updated keep the next read waiting. Show or hide sections, reorder them, pick libraries, and resume anywhere thanks to synced history and infinite scroll.

• Deep Series & Collection Views: Series pages surface release timelines, reading directions, publishers, genres, tags, alternate titles, creators, links, timestamps, summaries, and parent collections alongside actions to edit, analyze, refresh metadata, mark read/unread, add to collections, or delete. Collection pages display layouts, counts, dates, and filters with multi-select batch removal plus inline edit/delete.

• Dual-Format Readers: Comic reader supports LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon (Webtoon on iOS/iPadOS) with dual-page spreads, pinch zoom (iOS/iPadOS/macOS), customizable tap zones, quick page jumps, and exports (JPEG, PNG, HEIF, WebP). EPUB reader (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) keeps books offline or incognito with adjustable fonts, themes, pagination, column layouts, and an optional image-first mode. tvOS adds DIVINA reading tuned for the Siri Remote.

• Admin & Monitoring Tools: Edit metadata, manage collections and read lists, trigger scans or analyses per library or globally, and inspect server info plus a metrics dashboard showing disk usage, task analytics, and per-library stats. Task analytics include execution counts, total time, inline errors, and cancel-all controls. SSE delivers live updates for task queues, thumbnail generation, session expiry, and dashboard refreshes with opt-in notifications and independent toggles for automation.

• Smart Caching & Offline Access: Three-tier caching (pages, book files, thumbnails) keeps everything instant while respecting storage. Adjust limits, monitor size and file counts, clear caches individually, and let automatic cleanup protect space. Recently viewed pages and downloaded EPUB files remain available offline.

• Native Apple Experience: Layouts tailored to each platform bring a dedicated macOS reader window, extensive keyboard shortcuts, customizable theme colors, orientation-aware column counts, adjustable Webtoon width (iOS/iPadOS), tap zone hints, incognito reading, and focus-friendly tvOS navigation. Dashboard preferences let you reorder sections and filter by libraries.

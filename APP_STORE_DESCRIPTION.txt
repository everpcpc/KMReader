KMReader - Native Komga Reader for iOS, macOS & tvOS

KMReader keeps every Komga library close on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Save multiple servers, browse adaptive dashboards, and read comics or EPUBs with settings that travel across devices.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Multi-Server Vault: Sign in to unlimited Komga servers with custom names and role-aware access. Supports both password and API key authentication. Remove a profile to clear cached pages, downloads, and credentials stored on-device.

• Cloud-Drive-Like Offline: Series and books support offline policies (manual, latest, all) with automatic downloads and smart sync—just like a cloud drive. Live Activity shows download progress on the lock screen and Dynamic Island for iOS. Automatic offline mode switching detects network errors and notifies you. Read progress made offline queues locally and syncs when connection restores. Browse dashboards, libraries, series, and collections seamlessly with cached data. Switch between online and offline reading without interruption.

• Browse and Dashboards: Series, books, collections, and read lists share search, filters, grid/list layouts, and an orientation-aware layout picker. Dashboard sections (Keep Reading, On Deck, Recently Added/Read/Released/Updated) can be reordered or hidden per library with infinite scroll.

• Readers for Every Platform: DIVINA supports LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon on iOS/iPadOS/macOS/tvOS with spreads, zoom, configurable tap zones, quick jumps, exports, tvOS remote gestures, and a macOS reader window. EPUB on iOS/iPadOS/macOS adds offline downloads, custom fonts and themes, pagination, column layouts, TOC navigation, incognito mode, auto layout, and an optional image-first mode. tvOS currently supports DIVINA.

• Admin and Live Updates: Edit metadata, manage API keys, collections and read lists, trigger scans or analyses per library or globally, cancel queued tasks, and inspect per-library metrics. Server-Sent Events keep dashboards, thumbnails, queues, and sessions in sync with optional notifications and auto-refresh toggles.

• Caching and Polish: Three-tier caches for pages, book files, and thumbnails expose adjustable budgets, live size/file counters, one-tap clearing, and automatic cleanup. Accent colors, Webtoon width controls, tap-zone hints, keyboard shortcuts, in-app log viewer, tvOS focus navigation, and incognito reading keep everything feeling native.

Connect your Komga server and keep progress in sync with real-time updates, streamlined caches, and reliable offline access.

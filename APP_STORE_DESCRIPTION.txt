KMReader - Native Komga Reader for iOS, macOS & tvOS

KMReader keeps every Komga library a tap away on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. Store unlimited servers, jump between dashboards, and sink into polished comic and EPUB readers that stay in sync no matter where you are.

HIGHLIGHTS

• Guided Onboarding & Server Vault: First launch heads straight into Komga login, storing unlimited instances with custom names, last activity, detected roles, and human-readable auth history (IP, user-agent, API key). Remove a server to scrub cached pages, downloads, and credentials instantly.

• Adaptive Library & Dashboards: Series, Books, Collections, and Read Lists share one browse surface with search, filters, grid/list layouts, and orientation-aware column counts. Dashboard sections such as Keep Reading, On Deck, Recently Added/Read/Released/Updated can be toggled or reordered per library with infinite-scroll history.

• Deep Metadata & Inline Editing: Series and collection pages surface release timelines, directions, publishers, genres, tags, alternate titles, creators, timelines, and related collections. Inline actions let you edit metadata, analyze, refresh covers, mark read/unread, add/remove collections, delete, or multi-select safely.

• Dual Readers with Offline Control: DIVINA handles LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon modes on iOS/iPadOS/macOS/tvOS with dual-page spreads, pinch zoom, configurable tap zones, quick jumps, exports, tvOS remote gestures, and a dedicated macOS reader window. EPUB reader (iOS/iPadOS/macOS) keeps books offline or incognito with custom fonts, themes, pagination, column layouts, TOC navigation, and an optional image-first mode.

• Admin, SSE & Monitoring: Edit metadata, manage collections/read lists, trigger scans or analyses per library or globally, cancel queued tasks, and inspect disk usage plus per-library metrics. Server-Sent Events push live updates for dashboards, task queues, thumbnails, and session expiration with optional notifications and automation toggles.

• Smart Caching & Apple-First Polish: Three-tier caches for pages, book files, and thumbnails provide adjustable budgets, live size/file counters, one-tap clearing, and automatic cleanup so recent pages and downloaded EPUB files reopen offline. Accent colors, adjustable Webtoon width, tap-zone hints, keyboard shortcuts, tvOS focus navigation, and incognito modes keep everything feeling native.

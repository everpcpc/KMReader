## ✨ Highlights

- **Multi-server vault**: Save unlimited Komga servers with password or API key authentication.
- **Cloud-drive-like offline**: Background downloads with Live Activity on iOS. Offline policies (manual, latest, all) per series. Progress syncs when connection restores.
- **Browse + dashboards**: Search, filters, grid/list layouts. Customizable dashboard sections per library.
- **Readers**: DIVINA (LTR/RTL/vertical/Webtoon) with spreads, zoom, tap zones, and exports. EPUB with custom fonts/themes, pagination, TOC navigation, and incognito mode.
- **Admin tools**: Metadata editing, scans, task management, and live metrics via SSE.
- **Caching**: Three-tier caches (pages, books, thumbnails) with adjustable limits and auto-cleanup.

---

## 🧭 Overview

- Shared SwiftUI scenes cover browsing, reading, dashboards, and admin tasks across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV.
- SwiftData stores Komga instances, libraries, and custom fonts so server profiles, cache budgets, and dashboard preferences stay local per device.
- Services centralize API access, authentication, caching, SSE subscriptions, and error handling for consistent behavior on every platform.
- Local storage keeps profiles, recent activity, and cached downloads so switching servers does not reset your state.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Prerequisites: iOS 17.0+, macOS 14.0+, tvOS 17.0+, Xcode 15.0+.
2. Clone and open the project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/everpcpc/KMReader.git
   cd KMReader
   open KMReader.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build and run on your target device or simulator, then enter your Komga server URL and credentials.

Build helpers (optional):

- `make build-ios`, `make build-macos`, `make build-tvos` for device builds.
- `make build-ios-ci`, `make build-macos-ci`, `make build-tvos-ci` for code-signing-free simulator builds.
- `make release` archives/exports all platforms; see `Makefile` for archive/export targets.

> tvOS currently supports DIVINA. EPUB and Webtoon modes are available on iOS/iPadOS/macOS.

## 🔌 Compatibility

- Requires **Komga 1.19.0** or later.
- Works with **Komga API v1 and v2** (authentication, libraries/series/books, reading progress/pages, collections, and read lists).
- SSE keeps dashboards and task analytics synchronized with toggles for auto-refresh and connection notifications.

---

## 🛠️ Debugging

- Verbose API logging is available in Xcode Console or Console.app (process `Komga`, subsystem `Komga`, category `API`).
- Sample entry:
  ```
  📡 GET https://your-server.com/api/v2/users/me
  ✅ 200 GET https://your-server.com/api/v2/users/me (45.67ms)
  ```
